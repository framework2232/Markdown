# MARKDOWN

#### _A Collection of Markdown Scripts_

Developed as a guide to aid myself and maybe others with common markdown terms and structure. A Google search will display several online guides that go into way more detail and address more items than I need to use. For me, this guide and incuded files are sufficient at the moment. :)
